      <H6 align=center>A version of this applet using Sun's Java plug-in is 
      available <A 
      href="http://alife.co.uk/eosex/plugin/index.html">here</A>.</H6>
      <H2 align=center>The Evolution of Sex</H2>The applet here is deveoted to 
      automata which simulate aspects of nature immediately relevant to the 
      evolution of sex.
      <P>The model presents a field of organisms which reproduce either sexually 
      (green organisms) or asexually (blue organisms).
      <P>
      <H3 align=center>The Red Queen - pressure from parasites</H3>In this 
      model, organisms are under attack from parasites - once infected they turn 
      red before dying.
      <P>Organisms are modelled as a collection of genes for disease resistance 
      - parasites have to match the 'locks' of their hosts to a specified degree 
      in order to be able to reproduce.
      <P>
      <H3 align=center>Gene repair - coping with genetic error</H3>In the 
      gene-repair model, only organisms with a low number of mutations are able 
      to breed.
      <P>Organisms with more than this critical number of errors turn red and 
      slowly die.
      <P>In this model, whether sex evolves depends primarily on the mutation 
      rate. With a low mutation rate, asexual creatures thrive. Increasing the 
      mutation rate causes sexual creatures to do better.
      <P>Note that increasing the mutation rate to its maximum level usually has 
      the effect of extinguishing all life, though.
      <P>Note that the gene repair model <EM>is</EM> capable of overcoming the 
      "two-fold cost of sex" (which may be imposed artificially by unticking the 
      "internal fertilisation" checkbox).
      <P>One interesting aspect of the model is that, in an environment where 
      sexual organisms usually have a slight advantage, asexual organisms may 
      often be produced in significant numbers buy simply manually clearing a 
      large area of the grid and allowing organisms to expand into it.
      <P>In nature a number of organisms reproduce asexually when environmental 
      selection pressures are reduced. Our model suggests that this may 
      sometimes be a natural outcome of natural selective processes, rather than 
      a response genetically programmed into the organisms involved.
      <P>
      <H3 align=center>General points</H3>The main reason for implementing the 
      model was to find out what environmental conditions would be most suitable 
      to provide selection pressure encouraging the development of sex in 
      organisms whose choice of mate is strictly confined to one of its four 
      neighbours.
      <P>The applet conclusively illustrates a number of cases where the 
      advantages of sexual recombination are sufficient to drive the evolution 
      of sexuality in such a population.
      <P>Sexual organisms are modelled as internally fertilising hermaphrodites. 
      This means that they need invest little in producing male adaptations as 
      elaborate adaptations make no difference to the success rate of seed.
      <P>As far as we are aware, the model here is the first to demonstrate the 
      ability of sexual organisms to successfully invade an asexual population. 
      No doubt this claim will be rapidly be withdrawn when (for example) 
      William Hamilton's second volume of collected papers finds its way here.
      <P>Another interesting feature of the model is that there is a switch 
      controlling whether the host organisms have haploid or diploid genomes.
      <P>The total size of the genome remains unchanged by this switch. Diploid 
      populations display significantly better parasite resistance than haploid 
      ones, and it is in diploid populations that the evolution of sex is most 
      readliy observed.
      <P>In the biological literature there are a large number of suggested 
      functions for diploidity. It has been satisfying to find a concrete model 
      which indicates that there is a significant advantage to diploidity in a 
      simple model of parasitism.
      <P>The model also exhibits a number of other features: large scale spatial 
      patterns occur and phenomena such as population oscillations may be 
      observed.
      <P>
      <H3 align=center>Future plans</H3>Our model does not demonstrate the 
      ability of "Red Queen" models to overcome the 50% cost of sex. We hope to 
      rectify this.
      <P>A more detailed study of how haploid organisms compete against diploid 
      organisms in response to selection pressure from parasites appears to be 
      indicated.
      <P>We have made no model of sibling-rivalry pressures or "Vicar of Bray" 
      mechanisms which may contribute to the maintenance of sex. Though we think 
      these may be of significant importance under some circumstances, their 
      role in the origin of sex appears to be low, and it appears unlikely that 
      such effects will be of significant relevance to our main project. 
      Consequently, we have no plans to model these effects at this stage.
      <P>Our model deals with the origin of sexual recombination, <EM>not</EM> 
      the origin of males and females. There are a number of theories which 
      suggest important roles for sexual dimorphism - and at least one of these 
      is amenable to computer simulation. These theories are of some interest on 
      theoretical grounds - but again, at this stage are largely periphereal to 
      our main project.

      <H2 align=center>Interactive controls</H2>Controls are essentially the 
      same as they are for <A href="http://alife.co.uk/hal/index.html">HAL</A>, 
      with a few differences: 
      <UL>
        <LI>Model type - illustrate parasite pressure or gene repair theories; 
        <LI>The rate of cell growth - controls how fast healthy organisms grow; 
        <LI>The rate of disease spread - controls how rapidly parasites 
        reproduce; 
        <LI>The rate of cell death - controls how fast infected organisms die - 
        slow death of infected hosts produces larger scale patterns, but it also 
        increases the chance that the parasites will wipe out small populations 
        completely; 
        <LI>The rate of infection - controls how closely host genes and parasite 
        genes need to match before parasites can reproduce; 
        <LI>Allow reinfection - if ticked, infected cells may be reinfected; 
        <LI>Diploid hosts - if ticked, host cells use diploid recombination. Use 
        of a diploid crossover operator appears to magnify the advantage of sex. 

        <LI>Internal fertilisation - if unticked, sexual organisms are penalised 
        by reducing their fertility by a factor of two. This currently prevents 
        sexual organisms from competing effectively. 
        <LI>Display - controls which aspect of the automata is presented: 
        <UL>
          <LI>Species - infected organisms are coloured by the 'strain' of the 
          infection; 
          <LI>Health - infected organisms are coloured according to their 
          health; </LI></UL>
        <LI>Mutation rate - controls how rapidly the genes for parasite 
        resistance in the host species change with time; </LI></UL>
